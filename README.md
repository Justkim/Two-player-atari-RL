### **Abstract**  
This is an implementation of two player training in ten Atari 2600 environments by using the Atari RAM as the input, using self-play. There is an option to use an already trained single-player network and only train the final layer to leverage the knowledge gained in single-player Atari environments.
Our results show that by using transfer from single-player instead of training from scratch, the overall average score gained by the agent improves in some of the games.
